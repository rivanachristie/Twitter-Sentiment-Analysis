# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. In our project, we will perform sentiment analysis on tweets by training different machine learning and deep learning models like Na√Øve Bayes, CNN and LSTM in combination with word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText on the Sentiment140 dataset.

# About the dataset
The Sentiment140 allows you to discover the sentiment of a brand, product, or topic on Twitter. The data is a CSV with
emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:
1. the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive)
2. the id of the tweet
3. the date of the tweet
4. the query, if there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
5. the user that tweeted
6. the text of the tweet
