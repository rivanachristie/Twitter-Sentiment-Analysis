# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. In our project, we will perform sentiment analysis on tweets by training different machine learning and deep learning models like Naïve Bayes, CNN and LSTM in combination with word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText on the Sentiment140 dataset.

# About the dataset
The Sentiment140 allows you to discover the sentiment of a brand, product, or topic on Twitter. The data is a CSV with
emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:
• the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive)
• the id of the tweet
• the date of the tweet
• the query, if there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
• the user that tweeted
• the text of the tweet
